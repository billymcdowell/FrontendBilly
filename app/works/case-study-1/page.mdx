## The Problem

A static data application needed updating to bring in line with new data architecture and visual consistency.

## My Role

I was the sole UX designer on an Agile team comprised of 3 developers, a product owner. I was responsible for determining the overall design direction of the project, while collaborating with the product owner on ideation and requirements.

## How I came to my solution

User surveys showed that the workflow of setting up certain static data was convoluted and outdated. We decided to bring an updated user flow which was more in line with the companyâ€™s other user journeys in other similar applications.

## How my solution solved the problem

The proposed solution solved the problem by allowing the user to set up multiple static data points from a single screen and easily flick through the different data type tabs in a single page application to understand what is currently defined in the data mapping.

## Challenges

The challenges we faced were mostly regarding the amount of data that was needed to be shown and choreographing the user journey, so the user is only confronted with the information that is needed at that specific time. As well as, modeling the data into a simpler easier to digest way and getting rid of surplus and unnecessary data.

## Effects to the users and the business

Users are now able to easily and comprehensively understand the static data that is underpinning their everyday usage on the top-level applications.

## What I learnt

Because of this project, we realized the importance of prototyping and user testing for exploring new design concepts. As we started without them and quickly came to the conclusion that with such complicated data structuring, we needed to collaborate with the user to understand how they would want to read and understand the data.
