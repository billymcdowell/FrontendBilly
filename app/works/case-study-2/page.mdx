## The Problem

A process and flow were needed to bilaterally agree agreement terms, prior to trading.

## My Role

I was the sole UX designer on an Agile team comprised of 3 developers, a product owner. I was responsible for determining the overall design direction of the project, while collaborating with the product owner on ideation, requirements.

## How I came to my solution

Stakeholder interviews, usability testing, and user surveys showed the general flow was simple, and a conscious effort was made to keep it this way. After many wire-framing sessions, working closely with the product owner and usability sessions, we came to our final solution.

## How my solution solved the problem

The proposed solution solved the problem by allowing the user to easily set up and mutually agree agreement terms.

## Challenges

The challenges we faced were mostly regarding the amount of data that was needed to be inputted and making sure only the absolutely necessary data was inputted to keep the process as simple and easy as possible.

## Effects to the users and the business

Users are now able to focus on more important tasks as the agreement only needs to be set up once to allow the agreement of terms, thus removing many steps from the user's previous agreement flow.

## What I learnt

Because of this project, I demonstrated the power of usability testing to the product management team and have further distilled a user-led culture into the way that products are designed, tested, and implemented.
